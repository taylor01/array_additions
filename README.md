# ArrayAdditions
Adds a few useful to me methods to the Array ruby class.

## Usage
`.average` returns an average of an array full of integers.

`.find_duplicates` returns and array of duplicate values from an array.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'array_additions'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install array_additions
```
